# Project 3

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

A pizza shop website

Site Features:
- Menu: Supports all of the available menu items for Pinnochio’s Pizza & Subs (a popular pizza place in Cambridge).

- Adding Items: Using Django Admin, site administrators (restaurant owners) are able to add, update, and remove items on the menu.

- Registration, Login, Logout: Site users (customers) are able to register for the web application with a username, password, first name, last name, and email address. Customers are then  able to log in and log out of the website.

- Shopping Cart: Once logged in, users see a representation of the restaurant’s menu, where they can add items (along with toppings or extras, if appropriate) to their virtual “shopping cart.” The contents of the shopping cart are saved even if a user closes the window, or logs out and logs back in again.

- Placing an Order: Once there is at least one item in a user’s shopping cart, they are able to place an order, whereby the user is asked to confirm the items in the shopping cart, and the total before placing an order.

- Viewing Orders: Site administrators should have to a page where they can view any orders that have already been placed.

- Personal Touch: Site admins can add, remove and update menu items from within the site in the "updateMenu" link.
Special pizza selects 5 toppings at random. 
users are able to leave special instructions for how to prepare their dish.
